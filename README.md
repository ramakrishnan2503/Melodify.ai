# Melodify.ai - AI Powered Music Generator ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to **Melodify**, your personal AI composer! Melodify uses advanced deep learning models to create unique, captivating musical compositions with just a click. Currently, our model is trained exclusively on Chopin's classical pieces, ensuring a touch of timeless elegance in every generated melody. However, you can expand its creativity by training the model on a broader dataset. Easily generate, download, and convert MIDI files to WAV, all within our user-friendly interface.


## How It Works

### Model and Training Process

Melodify's music generation capability is built on a Sequential model with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, designed to handle sequence prediction tasks like music composition. Our training process involves:

1. **Dataset:** We obtained a diverse dataset of classical MIDI files, which you can access [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi).
2. **Preprocessing:** Extracting notes and chords, while filtering out rare elements to streamline learning.
3. **Model Training:** The model learns to predict subsequent notes based on previous sequences, ensuring coherent and melodically pleasing outputs.
4. **Music Generation:** The trained model generates new musical pieces by sampling from learned sequences, producing unique compositions every time.
